```
A slot machine with 3 columns and 3 rows, each slot contains one fruit. The fruits should be: Apple, Banana, Cherry, Orange, Lemon. Generate an vector style image for each fruit and use it to display that fruit. The fruits should be spawned by the machine at random. The user can press the spin button, which will trigger a spinning animation that moves the columns downward, spawning new fruit at the top repeatedly for 2 seconds. Once the spinning animation is over, if there are 3 of the same fruit in the center row, display a win message to the user, which they can share on their feed. The user should always be able to spin again, except while the spinning animation is in progress.
```

Update the app metadata and generate an app icon.

#### Update the app metadata and generate an app icon.  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement the slot‑machine app and update the app metadata:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update title, description, and image URL.  
2. `mini-app/public/icon.png.todo` – create a new icon image description.  
3. `mini-app/public/apple.png.todo` – description for the Apple image.  
4. `mini-app/public/banana.png.todo` – description for the Banana image.  
5. `mini-app/public/cherry.png.todo` – description for the Cherry image.  
6. `mini-app/public/orange.png.todo` – description for the Orange image.  
7. `mini-app/public/lemon.png.todo` – description for the Lemon image.  
8. `mini-app/components/slot-machine.tsx` – new component that implements the slot‑machine logic and UI.  
9. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – modify the home page to render the slot‑machine component and include the share button.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes.

I need to add a few new files to implement the slot‑machine UI and the image descriptions.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

1. `mini-app/public/icon.png.todo` – description for the app icon.  
2. `mini-app/public/apple.png.todo` – description for the Apple image.  
3. `mini-app/public/banana.png.todo` – description for the Banana image.  
4. `mini-app/public/cherry.png.todo` – description for the Cherry image.  
5. `mini-app/public/orange.png.todo` – description for the Orange image.  
6. `mini-app/public/lemon.png.todo` – description for the Lemon image.  
7. `mini-app/components/slot-machine.tsx` – the component that implements the slot‑machine logic and UI.  

Once those files are added, I can give you the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes to `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and `mini-app/app/page.tsx`.
